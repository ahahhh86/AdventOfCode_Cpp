# AdventOfCode
This is my attempt to solve the puzzles of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). It is still a work in progress.

For each puzzle the input is inside the folder "input" as a .txt file. There is a corresponding folder for the year when the puzzle was published and each file is named according to the day it was published.
The cpp files are named similar and are in the "src" folder. The solution for each day has it's own class and is inside a namespace according to the year it was published.

I made tests (while in debug-mode) to check if the code works properly even after changing something. The first tests are made from the text of the puzzle. The soltion of the entire puzzle is also checked, but this will only work with my input and will produce a fail if checked with another input.
